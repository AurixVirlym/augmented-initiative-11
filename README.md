# FoundryVTT Module

This module displays the HP, Structure, Heat, and Reactor Stress of each combatant in the Lancer combat tracker,
displaying no attribute if the entity doesn't have one (e.g. deployables don't have structure).

Big thanks to the Foundry VTT & League of Extraordinary Foundry Developers discord servers for helping me out!
